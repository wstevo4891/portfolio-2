  description: A Ruby on Rails side project where I attempt to reverse engineer
               the UI of Netflix.
  summary: Bolt Network is an on-going attempt to reverse engineer Netflix's
           front end. What began as a practice project on Codecademy is now a
           large application with 80 movie objects that uses Ruby algorithms,
           complex JavaScript effects, and serves images from Amazon S3. My
           additions include an animated, fixed navbar, a main slideshow scaled
           to browser width with jQuery, an animated search form using Regexp,
           and CSS3-animated carousel sliders built with Ruby and a modified
           version of Unslider. Using Bootstrap, jQuery, and my own break-point
           mixins, the views adapt to browser width to display elegantly on any
           device.
  highlights:
    - Netflix-style carousels on homepage that load with a Ruby algorithm
    - Carousels mimic Netflix hover effects with CSS3
    - Main slideshow adapts to browswer width using jQuery
    - Search bar mimics Netflix animation and searches titles with Regular Expressions
    - Navbar achieved shadowing effects of Netflix navbar
    - Admin record interface with AJAX
