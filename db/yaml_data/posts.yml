  description: My first Rails project was centered around some large
               application forms and the client wanted finished copies uploaded
               to his Dropbox account. Using Dropbox-SDK along with Wicked PDF
               and WKHTMLTOPDF, I was able to make this happen. First, I made a
               Dropbox app on the client's account for receiving files, then I
               installed the gems and pasted the app's secret keys in the
               Dropbox initializer. In the form's controller, I used Wicked PDF
               to make PDF copies of saved forms and the Dropbox API to upload
               them to the client's Dropbox app.

  description: My on-going side project to recreate Netflix's front end, Bolt
               Network, has some nifty do-dads, one being that all CRUD actions
               in the Genres index are executed with AJAX. If you're not
               familiar, AJAX stands for "Asynchronous JavaScript and XML." In
               human-speak, that means you can click on things that interact
               with the server without having to navigate somewhere or refresh
               the web page. In *Agile Web Development with Rails 4*, Sam Ruby
               says AJAX is for "making browsers suck less." Long before...

  description: After building some demo apps in Angular and being amazed by the
               live reloading feature of Grunt and Gulp, I desperately wanted
               to do this in Rails development. Two articles, multiple Github
               docs, and several hours of trial and error later, I got the damn
               thing to work! It's a somewhat tricky setup and requires an
               additional console window to the one running your rails server,
               but the fact that I will never again have to wait 30 - 50
               seconds to see the changes to my CSS3 animations puts a big
               stupid grin on my face.
